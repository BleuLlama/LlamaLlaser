# AmigaBASIC

This directory contains programs for AmigaBASIC communications with
the LaserDisc player.

Note that AmigaBASIC is only stable up through AmigaDOS 1.3.  And 
even that is being VERY generous.  I HIGHLY recommend NOT using 
AmigaBASIC to do this sort of thing, and to use another BASIC or 
another language on the Amiga. 

There were two goals with making AmigaBASIC support:
- Just to prove to myself that it could be done.
- If it can be done on AmigaBASIC, it can be done with any language on the Amiga. ;)


## Llaser.bas

A simple interactive program that has subroutines to shield the main program
from the lower level calls, and makes the main calling code a lot cleaner.

This might be a great starting point for your game... if you wanted to do
that kind of thing..


## Terminal_I.bas, Terminal_II.bas, Terminal_III.bas

These are three example programs from the book "Advanced Amiga BASIC"
by Tom R. Halfhill and Charless Brannon.  Originally published in
1986, but available here: https://archive.org/details/COMPUTEs_Advanced_AmigaBASIC_1986_COMPUTE_Publications/mode/2up
