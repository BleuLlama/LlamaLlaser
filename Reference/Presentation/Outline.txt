Commanding LaserDisc Players from Retro Computers

Overview
	- Vintage LD Players (NTSC Composite SD Video)
	- Where this system was used
	- The basic setup
	- Challenges
	- Modern replacements
	- Why?

History
    - Dragon's Lair, Space Ace
    - that hologram game, etc

Consist of a LDP with a RS232-compatible serial port.

Also use industrially for Museum displays, etc.

All systems are basically the same general shape
- Computer
	Arcade Game board (Dragon's Lair)
	Amiga		(Mad Dog McCree)
	Apple IIc	(Rollercoaster)
	BBC Micro	(Domesday)

- LD Player
	- Sony, Pioneer player with a RS232-capable Serial port

- Video interface
	- Separate monitors (easiest)
	- Genlock (putting graphics on top of video content)
	- Switch (one monitor for both, one at a time)

LD Primer
	- LDs store Composite video, Analog (not digital)
	- Stores the Encoded RF Waveform 
	(photo showing scanlines on CAV disc)
	- CLV - fit 60 minutes per side
	- CAV - one frame (two fields) per rotation, 30 mins per side
		- even though it's per-rotation, it's still a spiral track.
		- the laser can move slowly along the track to follow this
		- some players, like those used for video games like 
		dragon's lair, can actually seek up to 1 minute forward or 
		backwards without glitching.  Mine can only do a few frames.
		This is where the big cost difference in industrial players applies.
		- used for multispeed/scan forward/reverse
	- Frame numbers are baked into the video
	- but are not necessarily 1:1 for 30/60fps on the disk!- 
		Here's why...
		This gets a little into the gritty bits of how the video
		frames are stored on the disk, but it's essential for
		this process..

	- 2:3 pulldown from 24fps to (29.97FPS) 30FPS 
		This converts 24 frames per second of the original 
		motion picture film to 29.97 frames per second of 
		our NTSC Standard Definition video.  For simplicity
		sake, i'm just going to call this 30 frames per second
		NTSC.

		To do this, they repeat the frames in a process called
		a three-two pulldown.  There are a couple ways this can
		be done, but I'm only going to cover the more modern
		version that is easier to understand.

		Classic 3:2
		                 ** **     <- dirty "mixed" frames
		A B C D -> AA BB BC CD DD 
			   2  3   2  3

		Laserdisc players can move the laser in between 

		Modern 3:2
		(more judder, better compression)
		2:3:3:2     2  3   3    2
		A B C D ->  AA BB BC CC DD	
			B and C run for 1 field longer than A and D
			causing judder in slow pans, etc.

		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-two_pull_down
	- LD steps through the video like: A, B, C, D, E, F
	- The frame numbers are baked into one of the scanlines on the disk
		- like closed captioning
	- The player is smart enough to move the laser to catch the right fields
	- stepping through frames skips over the dirty/mixed frames.
		Original 24fps video
		    0  A
		    1  B
		    2  C
		    3  D
		    4  E
		    5  F
		    6  G
		    7  H

		NTSC frame 	LD Frame (reverse pulldown of sorts)
		   0 1 
		0  A A		00000
		1  B B		00001
		2  B C			(skipped)
		3  C C		00002
		4  D D		00003
		------
		5  E E		00004	
		6  F F		00005
		7  F G			(skipped)
		8  G G		00006
		9  H H		00007

	But if you were to capture the video output of it playing, you 
	will see the skipped frames that combine the two interleaved fields.

Footage examples to use:
	- show the player spinning up and moving the head assembly while playing
	- Beginning of discovision title with 00000 frame numbers
	- Seeking on the disk with squelch off

COmmandable Players
	- Generally made for industrial applications, so they last FOREVER
	- made to run with the disc spinning for hours/days without stopping
	- Generally have less user interface stuff.
		- mine has no buttons or display on the front for consumer usage
		- on screen display is minimal and disabled by default

	- RS232 interface, easy to command.

Commanding
	- Companies have their own protocols. Sony and Pioneer for example
	I will cover some Pioneer commands from their "Level 3" protocol here.
	- L3 contained commands for
		- CD controlling (newer models)
		- DVD controlling (newest models)
		- disc status (playing, stopped, current frame, time, chapter)
		- Commanding
			- Seek to frame/chapter/timecode X
			- Play
			- Step forward/backward
			- Slow speed forward/backward, multiple speeds
			- Turn off Screen or audio squelch (FUN!)
	- VERY simple text-based protocol!
		usually the sequence is:
		2 characters for what a number means (FRame, CHapter)
		1-5 numerical digits for the value
		2 character sequence for command
		[RETURN] <CR>  '\r'
	    returned from the disk are things like:
		R<CR>		player is ready (no error)
		E01<CR>		error code 01
		22930<CR>	number sequence

Example program
	Spin up disc, seek to frame 0
		PL<CR> 		R<CR>
	Seek to end of disc
		(FRame mode, LO lead-out of disk (end), SEek and stillframe)
		FRLOSE<CR> 	<time>		 R<CR>
	Get frame number (last frame)
		?F<CR>
				12000<CR>
	Seek to frame 12342, and stillframe
		FR12342SE<CR>	 <time>	 R<CR>
	Stillframe forward by one frame
		SF<CR>
				R<CR>

	Seek to frame 12400 then play
		FR12400PL<CR> 	<time>

Other Cool Things To Do:
	- disable video/audio squelch on seek, pause
		192RB<CR>	R<CR>
		(demo)

	- Multispeed (slow/fast playback)

	- Onscreen text (9 lines 0..9, up to 20 chars per line)
	turn on onscreen text only
		4RA<CR> 	R<CR>	
	print text on line 1
		1PR<CR>		R<CR>
	print it
		HELLO<CR>	R<CR>
	- Disable remote controls
		0KL<CR>		R<CR>
	- Wait on number button input from controller
		?N<CR>		(wait)	7<CR>	(user pressed '7')
	- Get last pressed of ANY button (without wating)
		#I<CR>		17<CR>		(user last pressed 'play')
	- or break out if there's a problem:
		CL<CR>		R<CR>

Platforms
	- Apple IIc - super serial card
	- Amiga - AmigaBasiC
	- Tandy 100/102/200 - MS Basic

		- $200
		Required User Level: Arcade owner, Hardcore
	- Domesday Project
		- Made for preserving the Domesday LaserDisc + BBC Micro
		systems from the UK in the 1980s.
		- Captures the actual RF stream from the disc itself
		- Stores a representation of the video SIGNAL. not frames.
		- Requires modified LD Player + $300 capture hardware
		- High end system to decode the stream and play it back
		- 75 gigabytes per side (30 mins) of a disk
		Required User level: Preservationist, Hardcore
	- LlamaLlaser
		- Capture system is: (LL-CAP)
			LD Player -> Firewire DV bridge -> Mac
			Serial cable from Mac to LD player
			Python script to:
			- seek to a frame number
			- use quicktime to framegrab a PNG or JPG from the video
			- save it with the frame number
			- repeat
		- playback system is software running on a raspberry Pi Zero
			and a USB serial interface ($10 total)
			(LL-PS)
			- simulates the L3 Protocol interactions
			- Simulates playback and onscreen display
			- possible ideas: IR receiver for remote commands
		- Drop-in replacement for Pioneer players.
		- very cheap to make, reasonable capture sizes.
		Required User Level: Enthusiast

My github project has example programs for multiple platforms to get 
started if you want, and the LlamaLlaser playback system will be available
there in the near future.
