# LlamaLlaser

This repo is to contain various LaserDisc commanding programs and
experiments.

The inception of this project goes back to Kevin Savetz reviving
David Lubar's "Rollercoaster" game; "Adventures In Videoland", which was an
Applesoft BASIC program, running on an Apple II, connected to a
Laserdisc player via its serial port, containing the Discovision
release of the movie "Rollercoaster".  It was a text adventure game,
with laserdisc-provided visuals.  (links to come soon.)


# Repo Contents

## Resources
The **Resources** directory contains my command cheatsheet, and the
manual from which all of the content was extracted from.

## BASIC
The **BASIC** directory contains BASIC language programs that I have
written to do similar processes.  My version is based on the Tandy
200 portable computer.  It has a different syntax to Applesoft
BASIC, but I hope to have ports to it available eventually.

Mine is based on using a Pioneer CLD-V2400 player, with the NTSC
Image Entertainment disc "The Mind's Eye", which is available used
at fairly cheap prices, and contains lots of great 90s CG animations.


# Future

I will probably bring my LaserDisc simulator into this repo eventually,
and extend it to support the Level III commands that I am using in
my program.
